a) Comment out the using namespace std; and then take your time, read and interpret
the error messages.

The error message says that "string", "cout","endl" is not defined in the given scope. 
This is because "string", "cout"& "endl" are defined by the line "using namespace std;". This simply brings the definiton of
std into the current scope in the given code.So without it,we need to explicitly define the namespace in each and every command used;
that are "std::string", "std::cout", "std::endl" to access these definitions.

b) Also remove the Critter:: prefix in one of the methods in Critter.cpp, read and interpret
the error message.

The error message says that name is not defined in the scope. 
Here,as "name" is a private member in the Critter class definition,without "Critter::", the function definition is just a normal 
function definition as it does not represent the public method in Critter class.
So inorder to define a method of the class from the current cpp file, "Critter::" is required to access the class. 
So the code will not compile as the "name" is not in the scope.
The alternative can be to write the methods of the class in the header file itself.
