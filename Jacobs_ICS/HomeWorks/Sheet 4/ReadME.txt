1a) You only state the required properties but do not prove that they actually hold for the given relation [-1.5].
Note that for antisymmetry it is not sufficient to show that p can equal to w, it is necessary to show that this is always the case provided that p is in relation with w and w is in relation with p. 
1b) Again you only state and do not show the needed properties [-1.5]. 
1c) A partial order does not need to be total [-0.5]. 
2a) Your proof for the injectivity is very unclear but heads in the right direction [-0.5].
